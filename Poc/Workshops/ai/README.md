# AI Workshops

AI workshops to introduce the student to AI with exercises in notebooks.

You will need to install Jupyter Notebook.
We recommend you also use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) to avoid any dependencies issue.

In each directory, you will find the exercises, a README explaining the purpose of the workshop and the slides used during the workshop.
